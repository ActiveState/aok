strategy: 
  # Pick one of the following authetication strategies, and fill in all the
  # parameters required by that strategy:
  use: builtin # or ldap
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1) `builtin` Classic Stackato userid/login strategy.
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # no additional config needed for builtin strategy

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2) `ldap` Your LDAP server.
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ldap:
    host: localhost
    port: 389
    method: plain # other valid settings are: ssl, tls
    base: 'dc=example, dc=com'
    # uid is the LDAP attribute name for the user name in the login 
    # form. Typically AD would be 'sAMAccountName' or 'UserPrincipalName',
    # while OpenLDAP is 'uid'.
    uid: 'sAMAccountName'
    # Next two are optional. Anonymous access will be used if omitted.
    bind_dn: 'default_bind_dn' #optional, default credentials for user lookup
    password: 'password' #optional, default credentials for user lookup

    # name_proc allows you to match the user name entered with the 
    # format of the uid attributes. For example, value of 
    # 'sAMAccountName' in AD contains only the windows user name. 
    # If your user prefers using email to login, a name_proc as below
    # will trim the email string down to just the windows login name. 
    # In summary, use name_proc to fill the gap between the submitted 
    # username and LDAP uid attribute value. Must be valid ruby code.
    # It is possible to open security holes in Stackato through this
    # setting, since the provided code will be accepting arbitrary user
    # input. Administrators are urged to use this setting only when
    # absolutely necessary, and to check the entered code thoroughly 
    # for possible security implications.
    # name_proc: "Proc.new {|name| name.gsub(/@.*$/,'')}" #optional

    # try_sasl and sasl_mechanisms are optional.
    # Use them to initialize a SASL connection to server. If you are not 
    # familiar with these authentication methods, please just avoid them.
    # try_sasl: true
    # sasl_mechanisms: DIGEST-MD5 # or GSS-SPNEGO

# These are just overrides for the values in CC database_environment.

The rspec tests are to be run in situ on the VM. There is some futzing required
to set up the database. You have to copy your production db config overwriting
the test config:

    kato config get --yaml aok database_environment/production |\
    kato config set --yaml aok database_environment/test

and change the db name to something like aok_test:

    kato config set aok database_environment/test/database aok_test

Then set up the database:

    RACK_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:recreate

and you're ready to run the tests:

    bundle exec rake spec
